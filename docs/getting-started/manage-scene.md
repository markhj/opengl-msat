# Managing scene

There are many strategies and techniques to managing the contents of a scene
in OpenGL, and as well in OpenGL MSAT.

Please read more about: [Scene management](../render/scene-management.md)
and [VBO-managed scenes](../vertex/vbo-scene.md).

The basic idea with these techniques is that classes will keep track of the
objects that belong in a scene, and help updating the vertices of the objects
within it.
