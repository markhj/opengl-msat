# Public header

You can either use the public header, which exposes all
the assets you need, or you can include files individually
if you prefer that additional control.

## Include public header
You can include the public header like this:
````c++
#include <opengl_msat/public.hpp>
````

## Includes in documentation
In the majority of the documentation you will see a chapter
named "Include". When you use the public header you can ignore
this; it's meant for the programmers who prefer to manage the inclusions
manually.
