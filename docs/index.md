# OpenGL MSAT

**OpenGL MSAT** stands for **OpenGL misc. structs and tools**, and offers a number of useful structs and classes to ease and abstract the work with OpenGL.

## Getting started
In the **Getting started** chapters, we introduce different concepts form the OpenGL MSAT library.
Usually just in their simplest form. This is to get you started as quickly as possible.

Even though you have been introduced to different concepts, it's still recommended to read the specific
chapters for each concept, to learn about more feature, specific behaviors, pitfalls, and more.
